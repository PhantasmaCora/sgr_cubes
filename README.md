A small project to make a 'Minecraft' or 'Minetest' -esque voxel building game in Rust.
Uses the 'wgpu' crate https://wgpu.rs/ for drawing.
Still very much a work in progress at this point! Work is focused on internal data structures and such for now, so the extent of what you can do on running the program is very limited.
